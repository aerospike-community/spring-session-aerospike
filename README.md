Spring Session for Aerospike is an extension of the [Spring Session](http://projects.spring.io/spring-session/) project and provides an API and implementation for managing user sessions and persisting them in an Aerospike database cluster.

There is an [example project](https://github.com/aerospike/spring-session-example) which demonstrates how to use the Spring Session for Aerospike project.
